## 📱 Complete User Journey

### Step 1: User Sends WhatsApp Message
```
User: "What are the cybersecurity requirements for SOC?"
```

### Step 2: Message Flow
```
[Your Phone] 
    ↓ (WhatsApp message)
[Twilio WhatsApp API] 
    ↓ (HTTP webhook)
[ngrok tunnel] 
    ↓ (forwards to localhost:5000)
[isolated_whatsapp_bridge.py]
    ↓ (HTTP API call to localhost:2024)
[Your RAG System] 
    ↓ (document search & response)
[Gemini AI Formatting]
    ↓ (mobile-optimized response)
[Twilio WhatsApp API]
