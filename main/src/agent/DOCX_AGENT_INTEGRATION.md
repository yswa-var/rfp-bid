# DOCX Agent Integration Summary

## Overview
The DOCX Agent (from `main/src/docx_agent` and `main/src/rct_agent`) has been successfully integrated as a subgraph into the main supervisor system in `main/src/agent/graph.py`.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. DOCX Agent Subgraph
- **Location**: `main/src/docx_agent/graph.py`
- **Function**: `build_docx_graph()`
- **Purpose**: Handles all DOCX document operations including:
  - Reading Word documents
  - Searching within documents
  - Editing documents (with approval workflow)
  - Creating new Word documents

### 2. React Agent Components
- **Location**: `main/src/rct_agent/`
- **Components Used**:
  - `state.py`: State management for DOCX operations
  - `context.py`: Configuration context
  - `tools.py`: DOCX manipulation tools
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions

## Changes Made

### 1. `main/src/agent/graph.py`
**Added:**
- Import: `from docx_agent.graph import build_docx_graph`
- Created docx_agent_graph instance: `docx_agent_graph = build_docx_graph()`
- Added node: `workflow.add_node("docx_agent", docx_agent_graph)`
- Added edge: `workflow.add_edge("docx_agent", END)`
- Updated supervisor prompt to include docx_agent capabilities
- Added docx_agent to routing table in conditional edges

### 2. `main/src/agent/router.py`
**Updated routing logic to handle DOCX requests:**
- Added keyword detection for DOCX-related phrases:
  - "docx"
  - "word document"
  - "edit document"
  - "create document"
  - "modify document"
  - "read docx"
  - "write docx"
  - ".docx"
- Added supervisor message parsing for "docx_agent" routing

## Architecture

```
Main Supervisor System
â”œâ”€â”€ supervisor (routing agent)
â”œâ”€â”€ pdf_parser (PDF processing)
â”œâ”€â”€ create_rag (RAG database creation)
â”œâ”€â”€ general_assistant (Q&A)
â”œâ”€â”€ proposal_supervisor (hierarchical proposal generation)
â””â”€â”€ docx_agent (NEW - DOCX document operations)
    â”œâ”€â”€ docx_logic (reasoning about DOCX operations)
    â”œâ”€â”€ approval_node (human approval for write ops)
    â””â”€â”€ docx_tools (execute DOCX tools)
```

## How It Works

### Request Flow
1. User sends a message mentioning DOCX operations
2. Supervisor receives the message
3. Router detects DOCX-related keywords
4. Request is routed to `docx_agent` subgraph
5. DOCX agent processes the request:
   - For read operations: executes immediately
   - For write operations: requests human approval first
6. Result is returned to the main graph
7. Graph completes and returns to END

### Example Triggers
- "Read the project proposal.docx"
- "Edit the executive summary in report.docx"
- "Create a new Word document with the meeting notes"
- "Search for 'budget' in the quarterly-report.docx"

## Features

### Approval Workflow
The DOCX agent includes a built-in approval system for write operations:
- Write tools (like `apply_edit`) require human approval
- User receives a description of the proposed change
- Must approve with "yes"/"y"/"approve" or reject
- Rejected operations return informative error messages

### Tool Support
The integrated DOCX agent supports:
- Document reading and parsing
- Content search and extraction
- Text editing with anchors
- Document creation
- Structure analysis

## Testing the Integration

To test the DOCX agent integration:

```python
# Example test code
from main.src.agent.graph import graph
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Test reading a document
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Read the contents of example.docx")]
})

# Test creating a document
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Create a new Word document called notes.docx")]
})

# Test editing a document
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [HumanMessage(content="Edit the title in report.docx to 'Q4 Report'")]
})
```

## Configuration

The DOCX agent uses configuration from `rct_agent.context.Context`:
- `system_prompt`: System instructions for DOCX operations
- `model`: LLM model to use (defaults to "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo")

Environment variables:
- `MODEL`: Override the default LLM model
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for OpenAI models

## Dependencies

The DOCX agent requires the following packages:
- `langchain-core`
- `langgraph`
- `python-docx` (for DOCX manipulation)
- Any LLM provider packages (e.g., `langchain-openai`)

## State Management

The DOCX agent uses its own state schema (`rct_agent.state.State`) which includes:
- `messages`: Conversation history
- `is_last_step`: Recursion limit flag
- `pending_operation`: Pending operations awaiting approval

The main graph automatically handles state transformation between `MessagesState` and the DOCX agent's `State`.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add more DOCX tools (formatting, images, tables)
2. Support batch document operations
3. Add document comparison capabilities
4. Integrate with cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive)
5. Add template-based document generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: If you get import errors, ensure that:
   - `main/src` is in your Python path
   - All required packages are installed

2. **State Compatibility**: The subgraph uses a different state schema but LangGraph handles the transformation automatically.

3. **Approval Timeout**: If approval requests hang, ensure your runtime supports interrupts.
