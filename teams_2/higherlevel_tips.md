The most robust way is to host the LangGraph graph behind LangGraph Server and connect it to a Microsoft Teams bot built with the Bot Framework or Teams AI Library, mapping each Teams conversation to a LangGraph thread and delivering answers via runs/stream or webhooks for reliable, low-latency responses. For best tooling and Teams features, use the Teams AI Library (TypeScript/C#/Python preview) or, if preferring Python, use the Bot Framework SDK with a simple /api/messages endpoint that forwards activities into LangGraph Server using the LangGraph SDK.[1][2][3][4]

### Architecture
- Teams client sends activities to the bot’s messaging endpoint via Azure Bot Service, which routes them into an ActivityHandler/TeamsActivityHandler where message, invoke, and conversation update events are handled.[5][4]
- The bot maps the Teams conversation to a LangGraph thread, creates or reuses the thread, and issues a run to LangGraph Server using the SDK or HTTP API, optionally streaming events back to Teams during processing.[2][1]
- For long-running work, use LangGraph webhooks to post completion updates to an internal endpoint, then update or send messages/adaptive cards in Teams to present the final result.[6][7]

### Recommended stacks
- TypeScript/C# with Teams AI Library v2: best support for Teams features and developer tooling; build a “custom engine agent” and call LangGraph over HTTP/SDK as the reasoning engine.[3][8]
- Python with Bot Framework SDK: straightforward for conversational bots and integrates cleanly with the LangGraph Python SDK for threads/runs/streaming.[9][2]

### Step-by-step setup
1) Deploy LangGraph Server (self-hosted or cloud) and define an assistant/graph; confirm endpoints for threads and runs/stream in the Server docs or SDK reference.[1][2]
2) Scaffold a Teams bot using Teams AI Library templates or a Bot Framework quickstart, which gives a working /api/messages endpoint and Teams app manifest scaffolding.[10][9]
3) In the bot’s message handler, create or look up a LangGraph thread keyed by the Teams conversation ID and persist that mapping for multi-turn state.[2][1]
4) On each message, call runs/stream on the thread to receive incremental events for responsive UX, or runs/wait plus a webhook callback to update Teams when processing completes.[6][1]
5) Handle adaptive card submits and message-extension invokes via Teams-specific handlers (OnInvoke/TeamsActivityHandler) and forward their payloads as structured inputs to the graph.[7][4]
6) Productionize: send an immediate acknowledgment and handle duplicate retries since Teams may retry after ~15 seconds; implement idempotency and store durable state for thread mapping and run status.[7][1]

### LangGraph integration patterns
- Stateful threads: create one LangGraph thread per Teams conversation and use runs/stream for incremental events, which the SDK exposes with SSE streaming utilities.[1][2]
- Webhooks: pass the webhook parameter in create/stream/wait calls so LangGraph Server posts completion to a bot-side endpoint, letting the bot update the Teams message or card after heavy processing.[6][1]

### Streaming and UX
- For a fast UX, stream graph events and reflect progress in Teams using typing indicators and message updates while the run proceeds, or use a quick acknowledgement plus webhook to avoid Teams retries on long operations.[7][1]
- If streaming is complex to pipe through, start with webhook-on-complete and then iterate to event streaming once the basic flow is stable.[1][6]

### Python vs TypeScript/C#
| Aspect | TypeScript/C# (Teams AI) | Python (Bot Framework) |
|---|---|---|
| SDK maturity | GA support with Teams AI v2 and strong feature coverage for Teams [3][8] | Solid conversational bot support and official quickstarts, good fit with LangGraph Python SDK [9][4] |
| Scaffolding | Teams Toolkit/Agents Toolkit templates and guides for building AI chatbots [10][3] | Quickstart sample for Teams bot and standard ActivityHandler patterns [9][4] |
| Teams features | First-class Teams-specific handlers, message extensions, and agents model [3][8] | Teams handlers available via Bot Framework with Teams activity support [4][5] |
| LangGraph bridge | Call LangGraph Server with HTTP/SDK from action handlers in Teams AI [8][1] | Use LangGraph Python SDK for threads/runs/stream directly inside handlers [2][1] |

### Practical tips
- Always map Teams conversation IDs to LangGraph threads for durable memory across turns and restarts.[2][1]
- Prefer runs/stream for responsiveness; fall back to webhook-complete if processing exceeds Teams’ retry window to avoid duplicate deliveries.[6][7]
- Start with the official bot quickstarts/templates, then layer LangGraph calls inside the message/invoke handlers to keep the integration clean and testable.[9][10]

### Key docs to lean on
- LangGraph Server and Python SDK references for threads, runs, streaming, and webhooks.[2][1]
- Teams bot fundamentals and TeamsActivityHandler patterns, plus Teams AI Library for AI/agent scaffolding and app templates.[4][3]
