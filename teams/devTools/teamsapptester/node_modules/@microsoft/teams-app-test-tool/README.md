# Microsoft 365 Agents Playground

`Microsoft 365 Agents Playground` is a component integrated in [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-fundamentals?pivots=visual-studio-code-v5). This component helps developers to debug, test and iterate on the app design of a [agent/bot](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/what-are-bots) application in a web-based chat environment that emulates the behavior, look and feel of different channels.

This package is a CLI wrapper for Microsoft 365 Agents Playground component that aims for an easier integration between Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit and Microsoft 365 Agents Playground.

## Features

Microsoft 365 Agents Playground enables developers to:

- **Sandbox Environment**: Test and debug their agent/bot application in a sandbox environment that emulates the behavior, look and feel of different channels.
- **Reduce Local Debugging Frictions**: Remove the [prerequisites](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/tools-prerequisites#accounts-to-build-your-teams-app) to obtain a Microsoft 365 Developer tenant and side-loading permissions before debugging the applications.
- **Network Security**: No need to set up a tunnel with [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Microsoft Dev Tunnel](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview) to expose the local application to the internet.
- **Rapid Inner-Loop Iterations**: Quickly iterate on the app design and agent/bot logic without the need to re-deploy the application to the cloud.
- **Mock Data and Activities**: The Microsoft 365 Agents playground makes it easy to accomplish a test for complex scenarios such as `Send a welcome message when a new member joins the channel` by using mock data as well as built-in and custom activity triggers.

- **Reliable and Trustable**: You can trust the Microsoft 365 Agents playground because the application UX ([Adaptive Cards](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-reference#adaptive-card)) is built on top of the same rendering technology as in different channels.
- **Integration with Existing Applications**: The Microsoft 365 Agents playground can be integrated with existing applications that are built with [Agent SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/).
- **Easy Inspections**: You can inspect the interactions between your application and the Microsoft 365 Agents playground as well as the request and response payloads coming in and out of your application.

## Limitations

- Application manifest is not being processed in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground. This means features that enabled only through the manifest will not be available in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground. For example, [The Command Menu](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-commands-menu?tabs=desktop%2Cdotnet) will not be available in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground.
- Not all types of application UX ([Cards](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/what-are-cards)) are supported in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground other than Adaptive Cards.
- Some features used in the Adaptive Card are not supported:
  - [People picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/people-picker)
  - [Dynamic type-ahead search](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/dynamic-search)
  - [User mention](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#sample-adaptive-card-with-a-mention)
  - [Image stage view](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#stage-view-for-images-in-adaptive-cards)
  - [Full-width control](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/task-modules-and-cards/cards/cards-format?tabs=adaptive-md%2Cdesktop%2Cconnector-html#full-width-adaptive-card)
- Single Sign-On (SSO) is not supported in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground. This means the [SSO](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/authentication/bot-sso-overview) feature will not be available in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground.

## FAQ

Q: What should I do when some features I use in my application but it's not supported in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground?

A: You can always use the [Microsoft Teams client](https://teams.microsoft.com/) or [WebChat](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-webchat-overview) to test the features that are not supported in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground. If you are developing with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit, select the option `Debug (Edge)` or `Debug (Chrome)` to test your application in the real environment.

Q: How would I notice if some features are not supported in the Microsoft 365 Agents playground?

A: The Microsoft 365 Agents playground will show a warning message in conversation and log panel when it detects some features are not supported.

Q: Should I solely rely on the Microsoft 365 Agents playground to test my application?

A: No. We always recommend developers to test their application in the real environment before moving the application to production environment.
